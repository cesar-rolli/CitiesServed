# CitiesServed
Pinned served cities on a map from a list of cities.

## How to use it?
You need to open the code at code editor and choose between the real list (~300 cities) and the test list (8 cities).

This software need to have delay because the GeoPy's API blocks access if you run all 300 cities at once.
