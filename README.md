# CitiesServed
Pinned served cities on a map from a list of cities.

## How to use it?
*You only need main.py and served_cities.md*

Open the code at code editor and choose between the real list (you can find the list of almost 300 cities at 'served_cities.md') and the test list (the list of 8 cities is already at the code).

This software need to have delay because the GeoPy's API blocks access if you run all 300 cities at once.
